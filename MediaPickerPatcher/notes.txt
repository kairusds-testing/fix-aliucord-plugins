com.discord.media_picker.MediaPicker - Only used for guild and profile pictures
com/discord/widgets/chat/input/WidgetChatInputAttachments.java - This is supposed to be the file picker but I can't figure out where the file picking part is

"FlexInput.AddContent.Button.Launcher"
resource: dialog_add_content_pager_with_fab

So it's located in c.b.a.a.a which extends AppCompatDialogFragment
c.b.a.a.a is spawned by FlexInputFragment.java, if it changes you can find it because it logs "Add Content" right below
However overriding c.b.a.a.a$View$OnClickListenerC0050a would be pretty stupid so let's get the resource R.e.launch_btn if possible

Just kidding it's too hard, let's just override c.b.a.a.a and hope the class name doesn't ever change

About the media picker popping back up when you type on the keyboard... This is a bug from Discord, it happens even if you don't patch it.
~~I think they removed the keyboard button and forgot about this, because it's caused by the app calling a function to set the page only after you pick an attachment from the 'open' button, which changes it to the first page and brings it back up.~~
~~I observed this by hooking AppFlexInputViewModel.onContentDialogPageChanged(0), but this is just the function that reacts to the page being changed and does nothing on its own.~~

The ACTUAL reason: In FlexInputFragment there is a lambda FlexInputFragment$b that handles dismissing the media picker. It's called from obfuscated function f().
FlexInputFragment$b has a function run() that casts the media picker object to a base class DialogFragment. The problem? This is not the correct function!
c.b.a.a.a (Or AddContentDialogFragment before it was obfuscated) is derived from AppCompatDialogFragment which is derived from DialogFragment. The function name is lost, but it was probably dismiss() before it got turned into h().
Anyways, they SHOULD have cast it to AddContentDialogFragment and called AddContentDialogFragment.h(), this properly dismisses the media picker and doesn't leave it in a broken state.
